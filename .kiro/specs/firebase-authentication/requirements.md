# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Firebase Authentication into the existing flight schedule application to enable user login functionality. The application currently has a Login page with incomplete Firebase integration that needs to be properly configured and connected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using Google OAuth, so that I can securely access the flight dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Login with Google" button THEN the system SHALL initiate Google OAuth authentication flow
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard page
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect them to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using email and password, so that I have an alternative login method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message
3. WHEN a user submits empty fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stay logged in across browser sessions, so that I don't have to re-authenticate frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL persist the authentication state
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL check for existing authentication
3. WHEN authentication is valid THEN the system SHALL allow access to protected routes
4. WHEN authentication is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL redirect to login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log out of the application, so that I can secure my account when finished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication state
2. WHEN logout is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN a user tries to access protected routes after logout THEN the system SHALL redirect to login

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Firebase properly configured, so that authentication services work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Firebase SHALL be properly initialized with configuration
2. WHEN authentication methods are called THEN Firebase SHALL handle the requests correctly
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle Firebase errors gracefully
4. WHEN in development THEN Firebase SHALL use appropriate project settings
